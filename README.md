## Motivation

My motivation was to create a professional portfolio as a web developer where potential employers can view my profile and understand my capabilities a web developer.
 
I buit the project to create a friendly yet professional place online where both employers and peers can review and see my work.
Most employers do not like to look at a resume with bullet points on them, they want to get a feel for what the employee can bring to the table both skills wise as well as people and culture wise.
